# Cocoa Capacitive Detection

##  Project Overview
Cocoa-Capacitive-Detection is a non-invasive sensor system designed to measure the capacitance of cocoa fruits to determine their ripening stages and detect fungal infections caused by *Moniliophthora roreri*. The system employs a Sauty bridge circuit to obtain real-time capacitance measurements without causing damage to the fruit.

##  Motivation
Capacitance is recognized as an effective physiological indicator due to its correlation with moisture content, cell development, and glucose levels. Based on this premise, our hypothesis is that capacitance measurements are directly related to fruit ripening and fungal infection.

## Key Features
-  **Non-invasive detection** of cocoa ripening stages and fungal infections.
-  **Energy-efficient system**, optimized for field applications.
-  **Sauty Bridge-based circuit** operating at 10V peak and 1 kHz.
-  **Experimentally validated** under controlled conditions with CNCH13 cocoa variety.

##  How to Use
1. Connect the sensor to a power source.
2. Place the capacitive plates in contact with the cocoa fruit.
3. Record the capacitance values obtained from the measurement system.
4. Analyze the data to determine the ripening stage or detect potential fungal infections.
